# Heart Chamber Segmentation

Project for Image processing course.

I was given limited dataset of ultrasound images of heart (2CH & 4CH views). I tried few runs of U-Net arhitecture and best results I have gotten is **86%** on test sample.

The result can be seen [here (wandb)](https://app.wandb.ai/damirj/Unet-heart-chamber?workspace=user-damirj).
